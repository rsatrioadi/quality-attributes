- reasoning might be layered/modular
  - maybe ontologies should be modular/layered

- missing in existing approaches is the 'unit' of maintainability (feature, algorithm, (granularity of) functionality, ...)
  - the linking/relation between 'unit': evidence at a level of a method may transfer to the level of the class (one higher level of aggregation/granulatity/abstraction)
    - each level has its own 'experts' for detecting evidence
  
- there are separate experts for lifting/combining evidence from one level to the next
  
- may employ toulmin-style composition: conclusion of one may be evidence to the next level
